Topic: MynaPath
A MynaPath is a file URI String with certain automatic translations.

File URI strings generally look like this:
> file:/opt/tomcat/webapps/myna
> file:/c:/Program%20Files/Apache/tomcat/webapps

Notice that the file separator is the same for both Windows and non-Windows Operating 
systems 

Any MynaPath that begins with "file:" is considered absolute and is not 
translated

Any MynaPath that starts with "/" is considered to be relative to the <$server.rootDir>.

Any MynaPath that does *NOT* start with "file:" or "/" is considered to be relative to 
<$server.currentDir>  

See <Myna.File.toString> for information on creating an absolute URI from a MynaPath

See <Myna.File.javaFile> for information on creating a java.io.File object from a MynaPath
