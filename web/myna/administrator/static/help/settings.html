<div id="help" style="padding:10px;">
	<b>Administrator Email</b><br>
	An email address to which to send Myna related emails. This can be a comma 
	separated list. 
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Instance Name</b><br>
	A name for this instance. This plus the hostname should uniquely identify 
	this instance. 
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Instance Purpose</b><br>
	A short name that describes the purpose of this instance. Intended to 
	differentiate between levels of production. This value appears as 
	$server.purpose. <p>Suggested Values: DEV,TEST,PROD,TRAIN   
	<br><br>
	
	
	
	<b>Send email adminstrator on uncaught exceptions?</b><br>
	If Yes, and "Administrator Email" is set, uncaught exceptions will be sent
	to the adminstrator email as well as being logged.    
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Log Engine</b><br>
	    Myna supports the following Logging engines:
	    
	    <ul style="padding:5px;">
	    	<li> <b>Myna Log:</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent to the database defined by the "myna_log" 
	    		datasource. <b style='color:red'>This is the only engine that can be queried from the 
	    		Myna Administrator.</b> This should be a stand-alone database for 
	    		production deployments. Multiple Myna instances can use the same 
	    		"myna_log" database<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Unix Syslog:</b> <br>
	    		Only available on Unix-like OS. Logs are sent to the local 
	    		syslog subsystem.<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Log4j:</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent via log4j. See WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties 
	    		for configuration.<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Standard Output (Myna.printConsole):</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent via Myna.printConsole to standard output
	    		<br>
	    	</li>
	    </ul>
	<br><br>

	<b>Enable Directory Listings?</b><br>
	If Yes, when URL points to a directory that does not contain an index file, 
	a file listing will be displayed.    
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Max Requests</b><br>
	The maximum number of requests and Myna.Thread instances that are allowed to run at once. Once this 
	limit is reached, requests are held in a First-In-First-Out buffer until one
	of the running requests finishes. This is after any thread management done 
	by the servlet container, so if you prefer to use your servlet container's 
	thread management, you can set this to a very high value such as 1000. 
	<br><br>

	<b>Background Thread Pool</b><br>
	The maximum number of background Myna.ThreadPool requests that are allowed to run at once. Once this 
	limit is reached, requests are held in a First-In-First-Out buffer until one
	of the running requests finishes. This only applies when new 
	<a target="commonjs" href="../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/ThreadPool-sjs.html">Myna.ThreadPool</a>
	 is called with "background:true"
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Default Request Timeout</b><br>
	Default amount of time (in seconds) that a request can run without being 
	terminiated. This can be overridden by setting $req.timeout.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Thread Management Whitelist</b><br>
	Each regular expression in this list represents a request path that will not 
	be limited Max Requests. Good candidates for this are the Myna adminstrator 
	and fast running callbacks that are unlikely to put a high load on the 
	server 
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Standard Libraries</b><br>
	Standard libraries that are are loaded once at server start-up and are 
	cached until server restart or manual reload. Once loaded these objects are 
	sealed (unchangeable at runtime) to make them thread-safe. 
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	
	<b>Server Start Scripts</b><br>
	Server Start Scripts are loaded at the beginning of the first request after 
	server restart and Request Start Scripts. This is an 
	appropriate place for global objects that only need to be created or 
	initialized once in the lifetime of a server instance
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	<b>Request Handler Script</b><br>
	This script takes care of executing the requested script, as well as any 
	pre- or post- script handling
	<br><br>
	If the file name is not absolute (begins with "file:/") it is assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Only one request handler should be defined.<br><br>
	
	<b>CommonJS Search Paths</b><br>
	List of MynaPaths to directories containing CommonJS files. See 
	<a target="commonjs" href="../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/CommonJS-sjs.html">CommonJS</a> 
	for more information.
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Strict Syntax Warnings</b><br>
	If Yes, common warnings will be logged. This is recommended in 
	development as it will often find mistakes that are hard to track down at 
	run-time. Turning this off in production reduces logging and can improve 
	performance.<br><br>
	
	<b>Save Parser Debug Output?</b><br>
	If Yes, a copy of each page will be saved in /WEB-INF/myna/parser_debug/ 
	containing the translated EJS. This should be "No" in most environments but may 
	be helpful for troubleshooting parser errors or for translating Myna JS to 
	pure JS 
	
	<br><br><b>Log Profiler Output</b><br>
	If Yes, a table describing interesting events will be logged after every 
	page. To create your own events call <br><br><code>$profiler.mark("some label");</code><br><br> 
	See 
	<a target="profiler" href="../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/standard_objects/profiler-sjs.html">$profiler</a> 
	for more information.
	
	<br><br><b>SMTP Mail Host</b><br>
	Mail server to use for sending emails
	

	<br><br><b>Watchdog Properties</b><br>
	    When Myna is run from its embedded server, a watchdog process is started to monitor Myna
	    
	    <ul style="padding:5px;">
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Startup Delay:</b> <br>
	    		Number of seconds after starting Myna to wait before starting watchdog checks
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Check Interval:</b> <br>
	    		Number of seconds between watchdog checks. These are connectinos to Myna to /shared/js/libOO/health_check.sjs
	    	</li>
	    	
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Timeout:</b> <br>
	    		Number seconds to wait for Myna to respond to  a check
	    		<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Failcount:</b> <br>
	    		Number of failed/timed-out connections before restarting Myna
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Mem Free Percent:</b> <br>
	    		Minimum percent free memory
	    		<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Watchdog Request Mem Failcount:</b> <br>
	    		Number of failed/timed-out memory checks before restarting Myna
	    		<br>
	    	</li>
	    </ul>
	<br><br>
