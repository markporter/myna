Topic: Views

View Templates are .ejs templates used to render the result of an action. They 
are stored in app/views. Normally views are loaded automatically for a given controller and 
action by looking in app/views/<controller name>/<action_name>.ejs. Views can 
also be directly rendered via <Controller.render>

There are also two specialized kinds of view files: <Layouts> and <Elements>. 
Generally <Layouts> wrap view templates, and view templates include <Elements>

Views <Layouts> and <Elements> have access to several global properties 

View Properties:
	$controller				- A reference to the controller that called this view
	$model					- A reference to this controllers default model, may be null
	$params					- A reference to the params of the most recent action
	$page					- A reference to this controller's <Controller.$page> property
	getElement				- A reference to <getElement>
	[data properties]		- All of the calling controller's <Controller.data> 
							  properties are available as global variables
	[$FP.helpers classes]	- "Html" refers to $FP.helpers.Html, etc
