Topic: Behaviors
Behaviors are functions that are applied to the current object. 

Behaviors can be 
applied to either models or controllers to modify their functionality. If you 
want to add a set of functions multiple controllers or models behaviors are a 
good mechanism.

* Built-in controller behaviors are stored in framework/behaviors/controllers/<behavior name>.sjs
* Custom controller behaviors are stored in app/behaviors/controllers/<behavior name>.sjs
* Built-in model behaviors are stored in framework/behaviors/models/<behavior name>.sjs
* Custom model behaviors are stored in app/behaviors/models/<behavior name>.sjs

In the case of a name conflict, custom behaviors hide built-in behaviors

Example:
	(code)
		//in some_controller.sjs
		function init(){
			// loads the built-in PDF andJSON filters
			// Each of these has an "init" function that adds the appropriate 
			// before and after filters
			this.applyBehavior([
				"FormatPdf",
				"FormatJson"
			]);
			
			//loads a single behavior with options
			this.applyBehavior("MynaAuth",{
				whitelist:[
					"Main.index",
					"Main.logout"
				],
				redirectParams:{
					message: "Enter your AD domain credentials",
					providers:["ldap_ad"]
				}
			});
		}
