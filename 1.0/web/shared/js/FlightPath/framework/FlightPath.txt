CakePHP, CFWheels and Ruby On Rails. 

Before you begin:
* What is MVC? http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller
* What is CoC? (convention over configuration)? http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration

Myna FlightPath is an application template that implements may of the repetitive 
infrastructure web developers typically have to create to start working on a web 
application. 

FlightPath Features:
	Strong separation of data, business logic and display - Each of these can be 
		manipulated independent of the others. 
		
	Automatic model generation - 	If your application has a single datasource, 
		FlightPath will create models for that datasource automatically, just when 
		needed. FlightPath will also analyze foreign key relationships and create 
		related models. Data type constraints are also analyzed and become 
		validators. <Model>
		
	URL "routes"	-	It is possible with FlightPath to map virtually any URL to 
		an action. "appdir/book/get/12", "appdir/mypage.html", 
		"appdir/index.sjs?controller=test&action=run" are all valid URLs. An 
		action can even have multiple routes assigned to it. 
		
	Ext.Direct support	-	FlightPath provides a builtin-in controller to handle 
		Ext.Direct API calls <framework.controller.DirectController>
		
	Authentication and authorization	-	FlightPath comes with an optional 
		permissions behavior that can secure individual controllers or whole 
		applications <>
