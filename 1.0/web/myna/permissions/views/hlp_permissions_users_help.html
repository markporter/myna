A "user" is a unique entity such as a human or software service that has certain 
rights to perform actions in your system. A user can have one or more "logins". 
A login is a unique identifier with an authentication authority. Users are a 
global resource and are not associated with any particular application. 

<p>In this 
configuration screen, users can be added, edited and deleted. When viewing a 
user, click "edit logins" to manage the logins for that user.
