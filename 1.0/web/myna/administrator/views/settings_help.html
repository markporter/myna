<div id="help" style="padding:10px;">
	<b>Instance Name</b><br>
	A name for this instance. This plus the hostname should uniquely identify 
	this instance. 
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Instance Purpose</b><br>
	A short name that describes the purpose of this instance. Intended to 
	differentiate between levels of production. This value appears as 
	$server.purpose. <p>Suggested Values: DEV,TEST,PROD,TRAIN   
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Administrator Email</b><br>
	An email address to which to send Myna related emails. This can be a comma 
	seperated list
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Send email administrator on uncaught exceptions?</b><br>
	If Yes, and "Administrator Email" is set, uncaught exceptions will be sent
	to the administrator email as well as being logged.    
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Log Engine</b><br>
	    Myna supports the following Logging engines:
	    
	    <ul style="padding:5px;">
	    	<li> <b>Myna Log:</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent to the database defined by the "myna_log" 
	    		datasource. <b style='color:red'>This is the only engine that can be queried from the 
	    		Myna Administrator.</b> This should be a stand-alone database for 
	    		production deployments. Multiple Myna instances can use the same 
	    		"myna_log" database<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Unix Syslog:</b> <br>
	    		Only available on Unix-like OS. Logs are sent to the local 
	    		syslog subsystem.<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Log4j:</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent via log4j. See WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties 
	    		for configuration.<br>
	    	</li>
	    	<li> <b>Standard Output (Myna.printConsole):</b> <br>
	    		Logs are sent via Myna.printConsole to standard output
	    		<br>
	    	</li>
	    </ul>
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Enable Directory Listings?</b><br>
	If Yes, when URL points to a directory that does not contain an index file, 
	a file listing will be displayed.    
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Max Requests</b><br>
	The maximum number of requests that are allowed to run at once. Once this 
	limit is reached, requests are held in a First-In-First-Out buffer until one
	of the running requests finishes. This is after any thread management done 
	by the servlet container, so if you prefer to use your servlet container's 
	thread management, you can set this to a very high value such as 1000. 
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Default Request Timeout</b><br>
	Default amount of time (in seconds) that a request can run without being 
	terminiated. This can be overridden by setting $req.timeout.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Thread Management Whitelist</b><br>
	Each regular expression in this list represents a request path that will not 
	be limited Max Requests. Good candidates for this are the Myna administrator 
	and fast running callbacks that are unlikely to put a high load on the 
	server 
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Optimization Level</b><br>
	An optimization level of -1 indicates interpretive mode. Levels 0 through 9
	indicate that java class files may be generated. Higher optimization levels 
	trade off compile time performance for runtime performance.
	
	<b>NOTE:</b> Interpreted mode (-1) is considered a debug/development mode 
	and disables most caching. Specifically:
	<ul>
		<li>
			Scope caching: At higher optimization levels a single global scope is 
			shared among all scripts. This means Mina's standard libraries and 
			JavaScript's global objects do not need to be recreated on every 
			request. This saves time and memory usage. For thread safety, most 
			global properties cannot be modified at higher optimization levels.  
		</li>
		<li>
			DataManager Caching: At higher optimization levels, Myna a will not 
			check the database for table changes if a class cache already exists 
		</li>
		<li>
			Script Caching: At higher optimization levels, Myna a will cache 
			compiled sjs and ejs files unless the timestamp on the file is newer 
			than the compiled script
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Standard Libraries</b><br>
	Standard libraries that are are loaded once at server start-up and are 
	cached until server restart or manual reload. Once loaded these objects are 
	sealed (unchangeable at runtime) to make them thread-safe. 
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	
	<b>Server Start Scripts</b><br>
	Server Start Scripts are loaded at the beginning of the first request after 
	server restart and Request Start Scripts. This is an 
	appropriate place for global objects that only need to be created or 
	initialized once in the lifetime of a server instance
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	<b>Request Handler Script</b><br>
	This script takes care of executing the requested script, as well as any 
	pre- or post- script handling
	<br><br>
	If the file name is not absolute (begins with "file:/") it is assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Only one request handler should be defined.<br><br>
	
	<b>CommonJS Search Paths</b><br>
	List of MynaPaths to directories containing CommonJS files. See 
	<a target="commonjs" href="../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/CommonJS-sjs.html">CommonJS</a> 
	for more information.
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Strict Syntax Warnings</b><br>
	If Yes, common warnings will be logged. This is recommended in 
	development as it will often find mistakes that are hard to track down at 
	run-time. Turning this off in production reduces logging and can improve 
	performance.<br><br>
	
	<b>Save Parser Debug Output?</b><br>
	If Yes, a copy of each page will be saved in /WEB-INF/myna/parser_debug/ 
	containing the translated EJS. This should be "No" in most environments but may 
	be helpful for troubleshooting parser errors or for translating Myna JS to 
	pure JS 
	
	<br><br><b>Log Profiler Output</b><br>
	If Yes, a table describing interesting events will be logged after every 
	page. To create your own events call <br><br><code>$profiler.mark("some label");</code><br><br> 
	See 
	<a target="profiler" href="../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/standard_objects/profiler-sjs.html">$profiler</a> 
	for more information.
	
	<br><br><b>SMTP Mail Host</b><br>
	Mail server to use for sending emails
