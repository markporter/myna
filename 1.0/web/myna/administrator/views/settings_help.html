<div id="help" style="padding:10px;">
	<b>Instance Name</b><br>
	A name for this instance. This plus the hostname should uniquely identify 
	this instance. 
	<br><br>
	
	
	<b>Instance Purpose</b><br>
	A short name that describes the purpose of this instance. Intended to 
	differentiate between levels of production. This value appears as 
	$server.purpose. <p>Suggested Values: DEV,TEST,PROD,TRAIN   
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Administrator Email</b><br>
	An email address to which to send Myna related emails. This can be a comma 
	seperated list
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Send email adminstrator on uncaught exceptions?</b><br>
	If Yes, and "Administrator Email" is set, uncaught exceptions will be sent
	to the adminstrator email as well as being logged.    
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Max Requests</b><br>
	The maximum number of requests that are allowed to run at once. Once this 
	limit is reached, requests are held in a First-In-First-Out buffer until one
	of the running requests finishes. This is after any thread management done 
	by the servlet container, so if you prefer to use your servlet container's 
	thread management, you can set this to a very high value such as 1000. 
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Default Request Timeout</b><br>
	Default amount of time (in seconds) that a request can run without being 
	terminiated. This can be overridden by setting $req.timeout.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Thread Management Whitelist</b><br>
	Each regular expression in this list represents a request path that will not 
	be limited Max Requests. Good candidates for this are the Myna adminstrator 
	and fast running callbacks that are unlikely to put a high load on the 
	server 
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Optimization Level</b><br>
	An optimization level of -1 indicates that interpretive mode will always be 
	used and compiled scripts will not be cached. Levels 0 through 9 indicate that 
	class files may be generated. Higher optimization levels trade off compile 
	time performance for runtime performance.
	<br><br>
	
	<b>Standard Libraries</b><br>
	Standard libraries that are are loaded once at server start-up and are 
	cached until server restart or manual reload. Once loaded these objects are 
	sealed (unchangeable at runtime) to make them thread-safe. 
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	
	<b>Server Start Scripts</b><br>
	Server Start Scripts are loaded at the beginning of the first request after 
	server restart and Request Start Scripts. This is an 
	appropriate place for global objects that only need to be created or 
	initialized once in the lifetime of a server instance
	<br><br>
	If the file names are not absolute (begin with "file:/") they are assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Multiple scripts should be comma separated. <br><br>
	
	<b>Request Handler Script</b><br>
	This script takes care of executing the requested script, as well as any 
	pre- or post- script handling
	<br><br>
	If the file name is not absolute (begins with "file:/") it is assumed to be in 
	&lt;myna root>/shared/js. Only one request handler should be defined.<br><br>
	
	<b>Strict Syntax Warnings</b><br>
	If Yes, common warnings will be logged. This is recommended in 
	development as it will often find mistakes that are hard to track down at 
	run-time. Turning this off in production reduces logging and can improve 
	performance.
	
	<br><br><b>Log Profiler Output</b><br>
	If Yes, a table describing interesting events will be logged after every 
	page. To create your own events call <br><br><code>$profiler.mark("some label");</code><br><br> 
	See 
	<a target="profiler" href="../../../shared/docs/js/libOO/files/standard_objects/profiler-sjs.html">$profiler</a> 
	for more information.
	
	<br><br><b>SMTP Mail Host</b><br>
	Mail server to use for sending emails
