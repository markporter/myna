Myna Commandline Installation and Usage
================================================================================

The Myna commandline invoker consists of an executable BASH script file for UNIX 
("myna") or a command file for Windows ("myna.cmd"). This file is (re)created in
MynaPath /WEB-INF/myna/commandline every time the Myna server is launched. If  
the Myna installation is later moved, it will need to be launched at least once 
to re-create the invoker file. 


INSTALLATION
================================================================================

To install the Myna commandline, simply copy the invoker to a system path, or 
modify the system path to include this location. 

Common system folders:

   Windows:
   C:\WINDOWS
   
   UNIX:
   /usr/local/bin

Note:
If there are multiple Myna installations on the system, then the invoker should 
be renamed to indicate which installation it will use. Examples: myna_system, 
myna_prod.cmd 

USAGE
================================================================================
myna path [arg1 arg2 argN...]

Call the Myna invoker with a file to execute, and any parameters to pass to that 
file. The file does not ned to be inside the Myna installation, and does not 
need a file extension.

Example parameters:

   -w
   --error-level WARN
   --long-arg "This is a long argument"
   source.txt

Parameters will be parsed and placed into $req.data. Parameters that start with 
"-" will be treated as named parameters and the next argument will be 
considered the value of the parameter, unless it also begins with "-". Empty 
named parameters have a value of true. Any arguments that are not part of a 
named parameter are added to $req.data.arguments in the order they appear

Here is an example script "dumpArgs":

   Myna.print(Myna.dumpText($req.data));

...called via: 
   myna dumpArgs source.txt -w -error-level WARN --long-arg "This is a long argument" dest.txt

Output:

[ Object ]
  +-[arguments] [ Array ]
  | +-[0] source.txt
  | \-[1] dest.txt
  +-[error-level] WARN
  +-[long-arg] This is a long argument
  \-[w] true
  

UNIX Systems:

On UNIX systems you can create an executable Myna script by including the 
appropriate header, like so:

   #!/usr/local/bin/myna
   
   Myna.print(Myna.dumpText($req.data));
